Scorch is a Scala EDSL for concurrent orchestration. It is based upon the Orc Haskell EDSL described in Concurrent Orchestration in Haskell by Launchbury and Elliot.

The current implementation is a line-by-line translation of the Orc Haskell EDSL as it is described in the paper. I have tried where possible to translate the original Haskell directly. The source code would be best read with a copy of the paper next to you.
